* Presented by Paul Eggert
* How Computer Science saves Biodiversity
* Doctor Tim Haas
* scruffy cycad
* Problems to solves
    * peer to peer secure sharing of criminal intelligence
    * reconstructioning criminal social network from censured link data
    * construct persistent, self-healing, and self-restrating IoT robots to monitor political-ecological systems
* Aimed at middle-to-senior managers for for-profit orgs
* Biodiversity is going away
    * The sixth mass extinction in the history of the planet is underway
    * Most large, wild mammals, many fish species, and many rare plants will be gone by 2060
* Cycads, sharks, and elephants
    * For instance, the cycad plant, poached as a status symbol and investment, has been on this planet for about 280 million years. Dinosaurs 245.
    * The great white shark is endangered
    * African savanna elephant was added to the IUCN Red List in 2021
* What to do
    * To curb this non-reversible destruction, wholesale killing of animals and plants need to stop, and habitat destruction needs to be curtailed
    * But achieving these two goals will require initiatives that move people away from these behaviors
    * These initiatives need to be derived from credible models of those political-ecological systems that host endangered species
* Private enterprise could save biodiversity
    * Private, for-profit firms could save biodiversity by developing and running these initiatives
    * Really, how?
    * In short, by making biodiversity conservation profitable
* Selling to biodiversity-concerned customers
    * Step 1: A firm identifies a species they want to save
    * Step 2: They launch a new product or service called a biodiversity offering that is attached to a biodiversity project.
    * Step 3: They maintain a public-facing biodiversity dashboard that contains real-time, detailed, and audited information on the project and the species being saved
* Why would this work?
    * Firms exist to make a profit. Biodiversity offerings would be priced and managed to be profitable
    * Biodiversity offerings would tap into a giant market niche of people wanting to help but feeling powerless
* Firms are resourceful and distributed
    * Firms hold most of the world's wealth and expertise. Collectively, they have the resources to solve a planet-level problem
    * Because firms are not all under a single, hierarchical control structure, a few newly-minted tyrants would not be able to shutdown all firm-level biodiversity projects.
* Building a biodiversity project
    * First, the firm builds a model of the political-ecological system that contains their species
    * Based on this model, the firm identifies a biodiversity project that will encourages species-preserving behaviors
    * Finally, the firm implements this project and an attendant monitoring program that feeds real-time data to the firm's biodiversity dashboard
* Suggested biodiversity projects (ranked by effectiveness)
    1. Improving habitat by reducing the firm's raw material demands from species-hosting countries
    2. Improving habitat by relocating/shutting operations within species-hosting countries
    3. Reducing poaching by owning and operating a production/service facility in a city that draws people away from ecological hotspots
    4. Providing expertise, data, software, and hardware to international law enforcement teams fighting wildlife trafficking
    5. Owning and operating a private wildlife reserve
    6. Owning and operating captive breeding facilities for critically-endangered species.
* Needed technology
    * To be credible, political-ecological models need to be statistically fitted to parsed streams of new articles, and streams of ecological metric observations such as species abundance
    * These fitted models need to be simulated under different biodiversity projects to find ones that work
* Modeling a political-ecological system
    * Agent-based submodels make decisions about actions that affect an at-risk species
    * Agents include poachers, kingpins, consumers, farmers, wildlife protection agencies, and governemnts.
    * An individual-based submodel of how the targeted species' abundance affects and is affected
* Computational challenge: Model assessment
    * Runs of these stochastic, many-parameter models are expensive. Hence, massive computing resources and new optimization algorithms are needed to compute
* Computational challenge: Search for the optimal ecosystem management plan
* Forecasted actions under a proposed project
    * The following is a plot of the cheetah system simulator's actions history under a proposed project
    * Lines connect action-reaction sequences
    * One frequent action sequence or episode is:
        * poaching event
        * negative ecosystem status report
* An Example: An in-country
* Create companies to employ people who would otherwise be poachers
